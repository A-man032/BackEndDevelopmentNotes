# About Bitcoin

### Create

Bitcoin are created through a process called "**mining**", which involves competing to find solutions to a mathematical problem while processing bitcoin transactions.

**Miner**: any participant in the bitcoin network who use their computer's processing power to verify and record transactions to **rewarded with brand new bitcoin**.

On average, someone succeeds every 10 mins regardless of how many miners and how much processing are competing at any time. The protocol halves (减半) the rate at creating new bitcoin every 4 years and limits the total number of bitcoin just below 21 million coins. By the year 2140, it will approaches 21million.

>Due to Bitcoin's diminishing (递减) rate of issuance, over the long term, the bitcoin currency is deflationary (通货紧缩). Bitcoin cannot by inflated (膨胀) by printing new money and beyond the expected issuance rate.

**Bitcoin** is the name of the protocol, a peer-to-peer network, and a distributed computing innovation.

**Bitcoin currency** is the only application of this invention.

Bitcoin involved 4 key innovations:

- A decentralized peer-to-peer network (the bitcoin protocol)
- A public transaction ledger (分类账) （the blockchain）
- A set of rules for independent transaction validation and currency issuance (consensus rules)
-  A mechanism for reaching global decentralized consensus on the valid blockchain (Proof-of-Work algorithm)
