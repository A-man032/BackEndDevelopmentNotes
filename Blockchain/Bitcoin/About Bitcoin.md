# About Bitcoin

## Mining

Bitcoin are created through a process called "**mining**", which involves competing to find solutions to a mathematical problem while processing bitcoin transactions.

**Miner**: any participant in the bitcoin network who use their computer's processing power to verify and record transactions to **rewarded with brand new bitcoin**.

On average, someone succeeds every 10 mins regardless of how many miners and how much processing are competing at any time. The protocol halves (减半) the rate at creating new bitcoin every 4 years and limits the total number of bitcoin just below 21 million coins. By the year 2140, it will approaches 21million.

>Due to Bitcoin's diminishing (递减) rate of issuance, over the long term, the bitcoin currency is deflationary (通货紧缩). Bitcoin cannot by inflated (膨胀) by printing new money and beyond the expected issuance rate.

## Bitcoin is a protocol

**Bitcoin** is the name of the protocol, a peer-to-peer network, and a distributed computing innovation.

Bitcoin involved 4 key innovations:

- A decentralized peer-to-peer network (the bitcoin protocol)
- A public transaction ledger (分类账) （the blockchain）
- A set of rules for independent transaction validation and currency issuance (consensus rules)
- A mechanism for reaching global decentralized consensus on the valid blockchain (Proof-of-Work algorithm)

**Bitcoin currency** is the only application of this invention.

**Bitcoin wallet** is the most common user interface to the bitcoin system.

*According to the platform:*

- Desktop Wallet (the first type)
- Mobile Wallet (the most common type)
- Web Wallet (accessed through a web browser and store the user's wallet on a server owned by a 3p)
- Hardware Wallet
- Paper Wallet (print key, low-tech but highly secure of storing bitcoin)

*According to degree of autonomy and how they interact with the bitcoin network:*

- Full-node Client
  - Storing the entire history of bitcoin transactions (every transaction by every user, ever)
  - A full node handles all aspects of the protocol and can independently validate the entire blockchain and any transaction.
  - Consumes substantial computer resources (e.g., more than 125GB of disk, 2GB of RAM)
- Lightweight Client
  - Storing the user wallet locally and independently creates, validates, and transmits transactions.
  - Connecting to bitcoin full nodes for access to the bitcoin transaction information.
  - Interacting directly with the bitcoin network.
- Third-party API Client
  - Interacting with bitcoin through a 3p system of APIs, rather than by connecting to the bitcoin network directly.
  - All transactions go through a 3p.
